# Mython - My Python Interpreter
Magshimim workshop - middle of the second year.
## About
The interpreter was made with C++.
Supports variables, exceptions, basic types, lists, etc.

Example:
```python
>>> i = 2
>>> b = True
>>> type(b)
<type 'bool'>
>>> l = ["f", True, 3]
>>> l
['f', True, 3]
>>> del i
>>> i
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> b
True
>>> f = l
>>> f
['f', True, 3] 
```
